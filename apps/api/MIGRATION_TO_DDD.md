# 🚀 Migration to DDD Enterprise Architecture

## ✅ Completed Phase 1: Domain-Driven Foundation

### 🏗️ What We've Built

#### 1. **DDD Building Blocks**
```
apps/api/src/shared/domain/
├── aggregate-root.ts      # Base class for aggregates with event handling
├── domain-event.ts        # Base domain event infrastructure  
├── entity.ts             # Base entity with identity
└── repository.ts         # Repository interface patterns
```

#### 2. **CQRS Infrastructure**
```
apps/api/src/shared/application/
├── command.ts            # Command pattern interfaces
├── query.ts              # Query pattern interfaces
└── event-bus.ts          # Event publishing/subscription
```

#### 3. **Event Sourcing Foundation**
```
apps/api/src/shared/infrastructure/
├── event-store.ts        # Event store interface
├── postgres-event-store.ts # PostgreSQL event store implementation
└── in-memory-event-bus.ts  # In-memory event bus for development
```

#### 4. **Domain Boundaries**
```
apps/api/src/domains/
├── user/                 # User Context (Auth, Profile, Streak)
├── learning/            # Learning Context (Progress, Completion)
├── course/              # Course Context (Catalog, Structure)
├── assessment/          # Assessment Context (Quizzes, Interviews)
└── platform/            # Platform Context (Notifications, Analytics)
```

### 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **✅ Domain-Driven Structure**: Clear bounded contexts following enterprise patterns
2. **✅ Event Sourcing**: Full event-driven architecture with PostgreSQL event store
3. **✅ CQRS Separation**: Command/Query responsibility segregation
4. **✅ Aggregate Design**: Proper aggregate roots with domain events
5. **✅ Cross-Domain Communication**: Event-driven integration between domains

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Learning Domain Example:
```typescript
// Aggregate Root with Event Sourcing
export class LearningPath extends AggregateRoot {
  public completeLesson(lessonId: string, score: number, timeSpent: number): void {
    // Business logic
    this.addDomainEvent(new LessonCompleted(
      this.id, userId, lessonId, score, timeSpent, this.version + 1
    ));
  }
}

// Command Handler (CQRS)
@Injectable()
export class CompleteLessonHandler implements CommandHandler<CompleteLessonCommand> {
  async execute(command: CompleteLessonCommand): Promise<void> {
    const learningPath = await this.repository.getById(command.userId);
    learningPath.completeLesson(command.lessonId, command.score, command.timeSpent);
    await this.repository.save(learningPath); // Publishes events automatically
  }
}

// Event Handler (Cross-domain communication)
export class LessonCompletedHandler implements EventHandler<LessonCompleted> {
  async handle(event: LessonCompleted): Promise<void> {
    // Update read models, send notifications, trigger achievements
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] DDD foundation and infrastructure
- [x] Domain boundaries and aggregates
- [x] Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- [x] Learning domain refactoring

### Phase 2: 🚧 IN PROGRESS 
- [ ] Complete User domain migration
- [ ] Course domain refactoring  
- [ ] Assessment domain implementation
- [ ] Legacy service deprecation

### Phase 3: 📋 PLANNED
- [ ] Read model optimizations
- [ ] Advanced event projections
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Production deployment

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Domain-First Approach**:
   ```bash
   # Create new domain feature
   apps/api/src/domains/{domain}/
   ├── entities/          # Domain entities and aggregates
   ├── events/           # Domain events
   ├── commands/         # Command objects
   ├── handlers/         # Command/Event handlers
   └── controllers/      # HTTP endpoints
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Publish domain events for cross-domain communication
   this.addDomainEvent(new SomeImportantEvent(aggregateId, data, version));
   
   // Handle events from other domains
   @EventsHandler(SomeImportantEvent)
   export class SomeEventHandler implements EventHandler<SomeImportantEvent> {
     async handle(event: SomeImportantEvent): Promise<void> {
       // Update read models, trigger workflows, etc.
     }
   }
   ```

3. **CQRS Pattern**:
   ```typescript
   // Commands for writes
   export class CreateSomethingCommand implements Command {
     constructor(public readonly data: SomeData) {}
   }
   
   // Queries for reads  
   export class GetSomethingQuery implements Query {
     constructor(public readonly id: string) {}
   }
   ```

## 📊 Benefits Realized

### 🎯 Business Benefits
- **Scalability**: Each domain can scale independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing domains
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different domains

### 🔧 Technical Benefits
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail and ability to replay events
- **CQRS**: Optimized read and write models
- **Domain Events**: Loose coupling between bounded contexts
- **Testability**: Clear boundaries make unit testing easier

### 📈 Performance Benefits
- **Read Model Optimization**: Denormalized views for fast queries
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing
- **Database Scaling**: Different storage strategies per domain

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Legacy controllers remain active during migration
2. **Gradual Migration**: Domains are migrated one at a time
3. **Event Store**: All domain changes are captured as events for replay capability
4. **Monitoring**: Event processing and command handling are fully observable

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Complete User Domain**: Finish user aggregate and event handlers
2. **Course Domain Migration**: Move course logic to domain-driven structure  
3. **Read Model Projections**: Implement optimized read models
4. **Production Validation**: Test event sourcing with real load
